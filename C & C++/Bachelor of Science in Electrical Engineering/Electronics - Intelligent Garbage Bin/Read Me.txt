Final Electronic Project.

My team developed an intelligent garbage bin that was able to open and close automatically,
play pleasant and appropriate music, show environmental messages on its front side and
inform the cleaning staff by Wi-Fi when the container was full.
I was in charge of the programming part of the project. We used the ATmega64L
microcontroller and the Atmel Studio 7.0 platform to develop the program in C/C++.
